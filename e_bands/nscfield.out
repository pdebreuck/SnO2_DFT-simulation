     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     Atomic positions and unit cell read from directory:
     ./SnO2.save/
 

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
